# Introduction to Natural Language Processing 2 Lab03

## HuggingFace Transformers

Today the lab session will be simply following the [HuggingFace transformers course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0), from chapter 0 to 4. Make sure you are familiar enough with it as we will use it for the final project.

## Sentence classification

Once you are done with the tutorial (or if you were already familiar with the library), train a sequence classifier head on `bert-base-uncased`, `roberta-base`, or `google/electra-base-discriminator`. Compare the results with what you had with fastText, and check wrongly classified samples.
